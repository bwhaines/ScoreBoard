ScoreBoard
==========

This is a simple Android application created by Brett Haines.  It allows users to record and update scores or values amongst
multiple players.  It also allows users to customize the names of each player, to type in scores or use up/down arrows to change
scores, change how much values change when using arrow keys, and change what score players begin with.
